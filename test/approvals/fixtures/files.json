These changes are intended to give greater control of playback to\n+users and to benefit publishers with legitimate use cases.\n+\n+Chrome's autoplay policies are simple:\n+\n+- Muted autoplay is always allowed.\n+- Autoplay with sound is allowed if:\n+    - The user has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).\n+    - On desktop, the user's [Media Engagement Index](#media-engagement-index)\n+      threshold has been crossed, meaning the user has previously played video\n+      with sound.\n+    - The user has [added the site to their home screen][customize-install] on mobile or\n+      [installed the PWA][progressive-web-apps] on desktop.\n+- Top frames can [delegate autoplay permission](#iframe-delegation) to their iframes to\n+  allow autoplay with sound.\n+\n+\n+### Media Engagement Index\n+\n+The Media Engagement Index (MEI) measures an individual's propensity to consume\n+media on a site. Chrome's approach is a ratio of visits to significant media\n+playback events per origin:\n+\n+- Consumption of the media (audio/video) must be greater than seven seconds.\n+- Audio must be present and unmuted.\n+- The tab with the video is active.\n+- Size of the video (in px) must be greater than [200x140].\n+\n+From that, Chrome calculates a media engagement score, which is highest on sites\n+where media is played on a regular basis. When it is high enough, media is\n+allowed to autoplay on desktop only.\n+\n+A user's MEI is available at the `about://media-engagement` internal page.\n+\n+<figure class=\"w-figure\">\n+  {% Img src=\"image/sQ51XsLqKMgSQMCZjIN0B7hlBO02/x0XKHYcLKjmDzjfxQxFg.png\", alt=\"Screenshot of about://media-engagement internal page.\", width=\"800\", height=\"280\" %}\n+  <figcaption class=\"w-figcaption\">\n+    Screenshot of the <code>about://media-engagement</code> internal page in Chrome.\n+  </figcaption>\n+</figure>\n+\n+### Developer switches\n+\n+As a developer, you may want to change Chrome autoplay policy behavior locally\n+to test your website for different levels of user engagement.\n+\n+- You can disable the autoplay policy entirely by using a [command line\n+  flag]:\n+  `chrome.exe --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required`.\n+  This allows you to test your website as if user were strongly engaged with\n+  your site and playback autoplay would be always allowed.\n+\n+- You can also decide to make sure autoplay is never allowed by disabling MEI and\n+  whether sites with the highest overall MEI get autoplay by default for\n+  new users. [Do this with flags][do this with flags]: `chrome.exe\n+  --disable-features=PreloadMediaEngagementData,\n+  MediaEngagementBypassAutoplayPolicies`.\n+\n+### Iframe delegation\n+\n+A [permissions policy] allows developers to selectively enable and disable\n+browser features and APIs. Once an origin has received autoplay\n+permission, it can delegate that permission to cross-origin iframes with the\n+[permissions policy for autoplay]. Note that autoplay is allowed by default on\n+same-origin iframes.\n+\n+```html\n+<!-- Autoplay is allowed. -->\n+<iframe src=\"https://cross-origin.com/myvideo.html\" allow=\"autoplay\">\n+\n+<!-- Autoplay and Fullscreen are allowed. -->\n+<iframe src=\"https://cross-origin.com/myvideo.html\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\">\n+```\n+\n+When the permissions policy for autoplay is disabled, calls to `play()` without a\n+user gesture will reject the promise with a `NotAllowedError` DOMException. And\n+the autoplay attribute will also be ignored.\n+\n+{% Aside 'warning' %}\n+Older articles incorrectly recommend using the attribute `gesture=media` which\n+is not supported.\n+{% endAside %}\n+\n+### Examples\n+\n+**Example 1:** Every time a user visits `VideoSubscriptionSite.com` on their\n+laptop they watch a TV show or a movie. As their media engagement score is\n+high, autoplay is allowed.\n+\n+**Example 2:** `GlobalNewsSite.com` has both text and video content.\n+Most users go to the site for text content and watch videos only occasionally.\n+Users' media engagement score is low, so autoplay wouldn't be allowed if a user\n+navigates directly from a social media page or search.\n+\n+**Example 3:** `LocalNewsSite.com` has both text and video content.\n+Most people enter the site through the homepage and then click on the news\n+articles. Autoplay on the news article pages would be allowed because of user\n+interaction with the domain. However, care should be taken to make sure users\n+aren't surprised by autoplaying content.\n+\n+**Example 4:** `MyMovieReviewBlog.com` embeds an iframe with a movie trailer to\n+go with a review. Users interacted with the domain to get to the blog, so\n+autoplay is allowed. However, the blog needs to explicitly delegate that\n+privilege to the iframe in order for the content to autoplay.\n+\n+### Chrome enterprise policies\n+\n+It is possible to change the autoplay behavior with Chrome enterprise policies\n+for use cases such as kiosks or unattended systems. Check out the [Policy\n+List][policy list] help page to learn how to set the autoplay related enterprise\n+policies:\n+\n+- The <code>[AutoplayAllowed][autoplayallowed]</code> policy controls whether\n+  autoplay is allowed or not.\n+- The <code>[AutoplayAllowlist][autoplayallowlist]</code> policy allows you to\n+  specify an allowlist of URL patterns where autoplay will always be enabled.\n+\n+## Best practices for web developers\n+\n+### Audio/Video elements\n+\n+Here's the one thing to remember: Don't ever assume a video will play, and\n+don't show a pause button when the video is not actually playing. It is so\n+important that I'm going to write it one more time below for those who simply\n+skim through that post.\n+\n+{% Aside 'gotchas' %}\n+Don't assume a video will play, and don't show a pause button when the video is\n+not actually playing.\n+{% endAside %}\n+\n+You should always look at the [Promise][promise] returned by the play function to see if\n+it was [rejected]:\n+\n+```js\n+var promise = document.querySelector('video').play();\n+\n+if (promise !== undefined) {\n+  promise.then(_ => {\n+    // Autoplay started!\n+  }).catch(error => {\n+    // Autoplay was prevented.\n+    // Show a \"Play\" button so that user can start playback.\n+  });\n+}\n+```\n+\n+{% Aside 'caution' %}\n+Don't play interstitial ads without showing any media controls as they may not\n+autoplay and users will have no way of starting playback.\n+{% endAside %}\n+\n+One cool way to engage users is to use muted autoplay and let them chose\n+to unmute. (See the example below.) Some websites already do this effectively,\n+including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube.\n+\n+```html\n+<video id=\"video\" muted autoplay>\n+<button id=\"unmuteButton\"></button>\n+\n+<script>\n+  unmuteButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n+    video.muted = false;\n+  });\n+</script>\n+```\n+\n+Events that trigger user activation are still to be defined consistently across\n+browsers. I'd recommend you stick to `\"click\"` for the time being then. See\n+[GitHub issue whatwg/html#3849](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3849).\n+\n+### Web Audio\n+\n+The [Web Audio API][web audio api] has been covered by autoplay since Chrome 71.\n+There are a few things to know about it. First, it is good practice to wait for\n+a user interaction before starting audio playback so that users are aware of\n+something happening. Think of a \"play\" button or \"on/off\" switch for instance.\n+You can also add an \"unmute\" button depending on the flow of the app.\n+\n+{% Aside %}\n+If an `AudioContext` is created before the document receives a user gesture, it\n+will be created in the \"suspended\" state, and you will need to call `resume()`\n+after the user gesture.\n+{% endAside %}\n+\n+If you create your `AudioContext` on page load, you'll have to call `resume()`\n+at some time after the user interacted with the page (e.g., after a user clicks\n+a button). Alternatively, the `AudioContext` will be resumed after a user\n+gesture if `start()` is called on any attached node.\n+\n+```js\n+// Existing code unchanged.\n+window.onload = function() {\n+  var context = new AudioContext();\n+  // Setup all nodes\n+  // ...\n+}\n+\n+// One-liner to resume playback when user interacted with the page.\n+document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {\n+  context.resume().then(() => {\n+    console.log('Playback resumed successfully');\n+  });\n+});\n+```\n+\n+You may also create the `AudioContext` only when the user interacts with the\n+page.\n+\n+```js\n+document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {\n+  var context = new AudioContext();\n+  // Setup all nodes\n+  // ...\n+});\n+```\n+\n+To detect whether the browser requires a user interaction to play audio, check\n+`AudioContext.state` after you've created it. If playing is allowed, it should\n+immediately switch to `running`. Otherwise it will be `suspended`. If you listen\n+to the `statechange` event, you can detect changes asynchronously.\n+\n+To see an example, check out the small [Pull Request][pull request] that fixes\n+Web Audio playback for these autoplay policy rules for [https://airhorner.com].\n+\n+{% Aside %}\n+You can find a summary of [Chrome's autoplay feature][chrome's autoplay feature]\n+on the Chromium site.\n+{% endAside %}\n+\n+\n+[200x140]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/1c63b1b71d28851fc495fdee9a2c724ea148e827/chrome/browser/media/media_engagement_contents_observer.cc#38\n+[autoplayallowed]: https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#AutoplayAllowed\n+[autoplayallowlist]: https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#AutoplayAllowlist\n+[chrome's autoplay feature]: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/audio-video/autoplay\n+[command line flag]: https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags\n+[customize-install]: https://web.dev/customize-install/\n+[do this with flags]: https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags\n+[https://airhorner.com]: https://airhorner.com/progressive-web-apps/\n+[noticed]: https://webkit.org/blog/7734/auto-play-policy-changes-for-macos/\n+[permissions policy]: https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/\n+[permissions policy for autoplay]: https://github.com/WICG/feature-policy/blob/main/features.md\n+[policy list]: https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/\n+[progressive-web-apps]: https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/\n+[promise]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\n+[pull request]: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/airhorn/pull/37\n+[rejected]: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/play-request-was-interrupted\n+[web audio api]: https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API"
